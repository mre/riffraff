## Installation

```Shell
go get github.com/mre/riffraff
```

...or download a static binary from the [releases page](https://github.com/mre/riffraff/releases).

## Getting started

You need to set the following environment variables:

```Shell
export JENKINS_URL="http://example.com/"
export JENKINS_USER="username"
export JENKINS_PW="password"
```

You might want to put those into your `~/.bashrc`, `~/.zshrc` or equivalent.

## Usage

```Shell
riffraff status jenkins-job-name
```

This will print the current status of all Jenkins jobs matching the given pattern (`jenkins-job-name` in this case).
You can use any regular expression for that, e.g.:

```Shell
riffraff status "^application-.*-unittests$"
```

You can get the full output of each last job matching the pattern with

```Shell
riffraff status -v "^application-.*-unittests$"
```

## Development

* Install golang version 1.11 or later for [go modules](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Modules) support
* Clone this repository to a directory in your `$GOPATH/src` tree (recommended) or use`go get -u github.com/mre/riffraff.git` (uses https not SSH)
* In the source folder run `go run main.go` to install modules and run `riffraff`
* If you don't have a Jenkins server you can run it by using its [`.war` file](https://jenkins.io/doc/pipeline/tour/getting-started/) (recommended) or installing its [`.deb` file](https://jenkins.io/doc/book/installing)

## OBTW

The tool is named after the [butler from the Rocky Horror Picture Show](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Rocky_Horror_Picture_Show:_Let%27s_Do_the_Time_Warp_Again), and not the rapper with the same name ;-).
